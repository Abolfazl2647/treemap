# Treemap (a heatmap like coin360) - D3,React

this project is for developers whom trying to integrate d3 treemaps with react into real project.
this is just an example, code is not mature but works fine.

# Developers Talk

in the first look it is easy to create such a map with d3 and SVG, and yea it is.
but when you add 2000 leaves to the tree everything changes. you dont have a map you just have lag which moveing around.

basically you have the follwing problems:

1- huge lag in zooming

2- update the dom when new data comes.

3- how to calculate the font size in zooming

4- zoom breaking after dom update

5- combining d3 and react

to get rid of the lag i spent 2 weeks and try 3-4 ideas to finaly get this to work.

# what is done

1- creating treemap Canvas with d3

2- creating a textlyaer for showing symbols on tiles on top of the canvas

3- only load the amount of data which is in the viewport and at leaset in an amount of size

4- when ever a new data came from the API, render waits until zooming finished

5- rendering tiles with canvas and rendering texts with react


# help

for sure this project needs to be better it is work great in Chrome but for other bowsers i have some issues like text rendering and frame rate.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
